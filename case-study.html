        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Waste-Less is a web app (Hackathon MVP) that helps households track
          groceries, split bulk purchases, and generate recipes that use what's
          already in the pantry - reducing food waste and saving money. The app
          highlights items that were previously wasted and prioritizes them in
          the next shopping list; it also supports bulk-splitting for cheaper
          groceries

        <h2>User Research &amp; Discovery</h2>
        <h3>Exploring Ideas & Choosing the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Our hackathon theme challenged us to design solutions with social
          impact. We brainstormed a wide range of ideas, but the one that
          resonated most strongly was dividing groceries between multiple users
          to reduce household food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through discussion, we realized that food waste wasn't just a
          household problem - it connected to bigger issues: rising grocery
          cost, market price manipulation, and the sustainability of local
          producers. This led us to develop the first draft of our app's
          purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Track the average calories consumed by a household and alert if
            purchases exceed typical consumption
          </li>
          <li>Suggest recipes that use leftover groceries</li>
          <li>Prioritze previously wasted items in the next shopping list</li>
          <li>
            Future feature: optimize recipes based on what users liked most
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>From here, we defined core functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Main Page</strong> with clear calls to action to sign up or
            log in
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Groceries Page</strong> to add, edit, delete and mark items
            as used/wasted, with a bulk-splitting feature
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recipe List</strong> with search, AI-generated suggestions
            and saved recipes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Waste Tracking</strong> that builds smarter shopping lsits
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research Insights</h2>
        <h3>1. Food Waste & Loss</h3>
        <p>
          We grounded our problem statement in global and national research on
          food waste.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <i>UN Food Waste Index Report 2024</i> highlights that 1.05
            billion tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2022, with 60%
            occuring at the household level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <i>FAO SDG Indicators Portal</i> emphasizes the urgency of
            halving global food waste by 2030 (SDG 12.3).
          </li>
          <li>
            Household waste is key driver - showing that an app focusing on
            family/roommate grocery management could create meaningful impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Key insights: Most waste comes from households, not farms or retail -
          making consumer-focused solutions the most impactful intervention.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Consumer Pricing & Costs</h3>
        <p>
          We also examined the economic pressures that influence grocery
          shopping.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The egg price-fixing lawsuit revealed systemic manipulation in the
            food industry, with $17.7 in damage awarded against Cal-Maine Foods,
            Kraft and others.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Canadian Competition Bureau's 2024 study identified limited
            competition in the grocery sector, driving higher prices for
            consumers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumers are pushed toward bulk purchases (e.g., Costco, big-box
            chains) as a cost-saving strategy, even if it increases the risk of
            household waste.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Key insights: Shoppers often over-purchase to save money upfront, but
          this leads to waste that negates the savings.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Local Farmers & Producers</h3>
        <p>Sustainability also shaped our thinking.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Loblaw's controversial “No Frills Farmers' market” campaign sparked
            backlash about corporate grocery chains undercutting real local
            farmers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Competition Bureau's grocery innovation strategy called for new
            types of grocery business, unit pricing transparency and stronger
            support for the independent grocers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Statista data shows that Canada's grocery market share is highly
            concentrated, with just a few retailers dominating.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Key insights: Supporting alternative grocery models (like bulk-sharing
          or independent grocers) has both economic and sustainability benefits.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Summary of Research Takeaways</u></h3>
        <p>
          From global waste data to Canadian grocery economics, our research
          showed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Households are the largest contributors to food waste.</li>
          <li>
            Price manipulation and limited grocery competition push consumers
            toward bulk-buying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bulk purchases save money upfront but often lead to spoilage in the
            home.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumers want fairer, more transparent systems that benefit both
            them and producers.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="problem">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Food waste is a global crisis - in 2022 alone, over 1 billion tonnes
          of food were wasted, with households responsible for 60% of it. At the
          same time, Canadians face high grocery costs from concentrated markets
          and price manipulation. The result: families and individuals
          over-purchase to save money, yet waste both food and income in the
          process.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="break-break"></div>
      <section id="brainstorm">
        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>
          During ideation, our team explored several directions related to the
          hackathon theme of sustainability and food systems. We generated ideas
          around automation, shared purchasing, and efficiency in meal
          preparation, then evaluated which had the most impact and feasibility
          for a hackathon MVP.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>1. Automatic Fridge & Pantry Tracker (Recipe Book)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concept: A system that automatically logs what's in a fridge/pantry
            and suggests recipes based on available items
          </li>
          <li>
            Benefit: Reduces “forgotten items” that spoil in the back of the
            fridge
          </li>
          <li>
            Challenge: Requires hardware integration or barcode scanning, which
            was too complex for a hackathon timeline
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h3>2. Wishlist/Online Costco (Bulk Splitting)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concept: Households or roommates can divide bulk products (e.g.,
            40-roll toilet paper packs) and split costs digitally
          </li>
          <li>Benefit: Makes bulk buying more affordable and less wasteful</li>
          <li>
            Challenge: Needed an intuitive way to coordinate between users in
            real time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h3>3. Bulk Cooking Planner</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concept: Helps households prepare large batches of meals at once and
            portion them out across the week
          </li>
          <li>
            Benefit: Saves time and ensures groceries are used efficiently
          </li>
          <li>Challenge: Relies on user commitment to cooking routines</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h3>4. Smart Grocery Deals + Purchase Tracker</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Concept: Cross-references grocery store deals with pantry stock to
            suggest the best items to purchase
          </li>
          <li>Benefit: Saves money while preventing over-purchasing</li>
          <li>
            Challenge: Integration with multiple grocery APIs would be complex
            to implement
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
          We combined the most feasible and impactful aspects of these ideas
          into our final concept: Waste-Less. Instead of building hardware or
          connecting to grocery APIs, we focused on tracking groceries,
          splitting bulk purchases, and generating recipes - features we could
          realistically prototype in Figma and implement in a working MVP within
          the hackathon timeline.

      <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection &amp; Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Working on Waste-Less during a hackathon pushed us to balance ambition
          with feasibility. Our initial ideas included hardware integrations and
          real-time grocery store APIs, but we quickly realized the need to
          focus on features we could design, test, and implement in 48 hours.
        </p>
        <p>Key lessons we learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Prioritize core flows first.</b> By focusing on the simplest path
            (add groceries → mark used/wasted → generate recipe), we created a
            functional MVP instead of spreading ourselves too thin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Design for clarity.</b> Accessibility and clean navigation
            mattered more than flashy visuals, since our users needed to quickly
            scan items and take action.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Collaboration is key.</b> As a team of strangers meeting at a
            hackathon, we learned how to quickly align on tasks and leverage
            each other's strengths (design, coding, research, pitching).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Impact needs simplicity.</b> The most compelling parts of our
            pitch weren't the “future features” but the clear, actionable MVP
            that solved a real problem households face daily.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <div class="break-break"></div>
      <section id="design-brief">
        <h2>The Design Brief</h2>
        <h3>Project Goals & Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          Waste-Less was designed to help budget-conscious households, families,
          and roommates reduce food waste and grocery costs. Our target users
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals living alone who struggle with portion sizes.</li>
          <li>
            Families buying in bulk to save money but struggling with spoilage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roommates who need a fair and transparent way to share grocery
            expenses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Rationale Behind UI Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Layout:</b> We chose a fixed header, sidebar navigation, and
            consistent footer to provide structure and make core features
            (groceries, recipes, waste tracking) easily accessible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Typography:</b> Clean, legible fonts ensured quick readability
            during task-heavy interactions, such as marking groceries used or
            wasted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Colour Palette:</b> We used a modern, clean base with accents of
            green (sustainability, “used” items, positive actions) and red
            (waste, alerts, negative states). This visual language made the app
            intuitive and aligned with the problem we were solving.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accessibility:</b> We emphasized contrast ratios, responsive
            layouts, and clear button placement so users could interact smoothly
            across devices.
          </li>
